# coffee-sales


The coffee sales project is an intermediate-level data analytics initiative designed to analyze purchasing patterns, sales trends, and customer preferences for coffee products. Utilizing tools like machine learning (ML), SQL, and Excel, this project focuses on examining a dataset that records daily transaction data from a vending machine spanning March 2024 to the present. Key tasks include conducting time series exploratory data analysis (EDA), predicting future sales for specific periods (day, week, or month), and identifying customer purchasing behaviors. Through techniques such as data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and basic machine learning modeling, the project aims to uncover actionable insights. These insights can aid in optimizing inventory management, enhancing vending machine layouts, and improving business strategies. The project provides a practical framework for honing data analytics skills while encouraging creativity and deeper understanding of the analysis process.
